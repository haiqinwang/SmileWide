SMILE-WIDE is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_network">Bayesian network</a> library. 

<p>

Initially, SMILE-WIDE is a version of the well known <a href="http://genie.sis.pitt.edu">SMILE library</a>, augmented <b>W</b>ith <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>istributed <b>E</b>xecution. This allows execution on verylarge datasets. As SMILE-WIDE is developed, BigData-specific capabilities will surpass the standard Bayesian network interfaces.

Programmer-facing, SMILE-WIDE is a .jar library which you can include in your software. 
User-facing, it is also integrated into Hive as a UDF to provide posterior probabilities 
of missing values, given the observed values for each instance.

SMILE-WIDE is written in Java, using the underlying SMILE library, which is written in C++. 
It uses Hadoop for inference on large data.
